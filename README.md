# smart-braille
As we all know that in this pandemic situation virtual learning is the only source of learning, but have u ever thought that how the blind people can learn. Blind people are restricted to read and learn only from the braille.  To sort out the above problem, i have a idea to develop a innovative smart class system for blind, that helps them to learn virtually.
Due to lack of vision, blind people are restricted to read and learn only those things which can be printed in Braille, so there is high rate of illiteracy among them, because from the old version of Braille, they are unable to learn from electronic source (internet) like smart class as the normal vision person can do.


There arev many disadvantages of old braile listed below;
Errors canâ€™t be removed in old version of Braille.
One teacher can teach only one student at a time, which means: to teach with old version of Braille lot time will required.
It is tough to teach by normal person, so blind children 

How my innovation is helps them?
The digital Braille is more preferable than old version Braille system, because it allows visual impaired person to read and learn from internet, so that they can get updated through current affairs.
By using the smart Braille system, smart class can be created for visual impaired students, so the teacher gives commands from computer and visual impaired students can see it in digital Braille screen.
It also allows that one teacher can teach many students at a time.
