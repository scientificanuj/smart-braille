# smart-braille
As we all know that in this pandemic situation virtual learning is the only source of learning, but have u ever thought that how the blind people can learn. Blind people are restricted to read and learn only from the braille.  To sort out the above problem, i have a idea to develop a innovative smart class system for blind, that helps them to learn virtually.
